		<p class="quote">This page is about who we are and what we do. Yeah, we raise chickens that produce eggs, which you eat and enjoy ... but just how does the egg end up in the store carton. You know, it's not born there. It's born here. In sunshine, grass, and fresh air, on a diet of goodness and happiness! - Professor Yolk</p>

	<h4>About Sunny Egg Farms</h4>
	<p>Sunny Egg Farms is a sister company of Sunny Farms Inc. Our goal and mission in life is to bring you (our valued customer), the freshest, healthiest, pesticide and herbicide free, non-GMO, anti-biotic free, additive free, ... in short the most natural and delicious food you can get short of growing it yourself. Our founder (who likes to go by the name of &quot;Professor Yolk&quot;), believes that if food was good enough to eat thousands of years ago when very little of the diseaseas we face today existed, why mess with perfection? In a world where the sales oriented desire for the biggest, heaviest, fattest, juiciest, and most eye-appealing food has led producers to tamper with nature, we believe that though our food hasn't been genetically altered to look bigger and better, it is better for you and even tastes better.</p>

	<h5>Help Us Help Others</h5>
	<p>When you buy our products, you not only get honest-to-goodness food, you help us contribute to ending world hunger and in fighting disease. Our companies have teamed up with health organizations around the world in developing cures for diseases, in fighting bug borne diseases, in helping to educate people on how to grow their own food and be self sufficient, and in donating food to organizations that aid those in need (both in the United States and abroad). We don't just throw money at these groups either. We hire people that aid in finding cures, teaching people about health and raising food, and we (including everyone from the President's to the farm hand), personally donate time to hand out food and participate in relief aid. So you see, just buying our products helps other people.</p>

We even have free classes you can take to train you how to do things. If you are interested, go to the <a href="contact.htm">Contact Us</a> page and submit your application now!</p>

	<h4>Egg Facts</h4>
	<p class="quote">Hover over the eggs below to see some egg-cellent facts! - Professor Yolk</p>
		<div id="fact01"><p>Did you know that eggs are a great source of protein? Most adults need 46-56g of protein a day. Just one of our eggs contains 6g of protein!</p></div>
		<div id="fact02"><p>Did you know that our chickens eat green grass, bugs, and seeds in a controlled area that is free from pesticides? We also feed them organic food and vegetables from our farms.</p></div>
		<div id="fact03"><p>Post-It Note for Moms. Did you know that eating an egg each morning while pregnant not only provides you and your baby with needed nutrition, but helps with the sickness?</p></div>
		<div id="fact04"><p>Put your eggs on their sides the night before hard boiling them in order to center the yolks.</p></div>
